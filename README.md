# sandbox

This repository basically serves as a dumping ground for any miscellaneous code,
small utilities, unfinished programs, etc. This was initially for storing just
my Advent of Code solutions but I decided to repurpose it.

  - [bin](bin/) - small programs
  - [comp](comp/) - "competitive" programming / puzzles
  - [etc](etc/) - random things that aren't standalone programs
