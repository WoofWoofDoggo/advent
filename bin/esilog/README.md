# esilog

A small program I made to help myself gather information during the [ESI3](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108190821/https://esi3.fun/)
Minecraft speedrunning tournament. It has quite a few bugs and is hardcoded for
my setup but it did what I needed it to do.

This folder also contains the creative hotbars I used during the tournament as
well as some stuff for the command block generation.
